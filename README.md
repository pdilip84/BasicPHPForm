# BasicPHPForm

Create a simple form using Bootstrap 4 & JS validation. Keep form fields simple for now like User name, Email id, Password, and Confirm password.

When the form is submitted Check for server-side validation & do variable sanitization. Do password hash as well. 

Use the PDO class to connect with the Mysqli database and complete a simple insert task.

Now Display your table on the same page and do Edit & delete concept.

Now Add some advanced fields like Gender (Male/Female as radio), User type (admin/guest) dropdown, Comments/Messages (Textarea), Profile image (Image upload), Country (List using API call) dropdown & City based on API calls with Ajax. Ohh... That's enough for now :)

Once you managed this, Bingooo! You are good to go ahead. Replace your table with a data table where you can filter data, order data, and much more. 

use sweet alert to display messages.

Finally, modify the form in such a way that deletes data call Ajax request to your data, and without page loading your data table will be updated.
